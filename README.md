# Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution: Simulation
This is a project to verify Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by finding explicit solution to the classical equation of motion for each particles in a system.

# System Requirements
Linux/UNIX Operating System, Python (>=2.7), PyGame

# Instructions
After downloading the project as zip and extracting, run "bash configure.sh" from within the directory. Follow the instructions thereafter to install the dependancies. Once installed properly, "bash configure.sh" will generate the final message: "We are ready to start the program." 

Then enter into the directory using terminal and execute "main.sh" script (using "./main.sh") and follow the on-screen instructions to generate the simulation.
